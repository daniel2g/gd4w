        </br></br>
        Before the 19th century, the Great Plains of the United States were home to hundreds of species of grasses. They were foundational for survival in this harsh environment, preventing erosion by wind and water, allowing heavy rains to absorb into the ground, and providing a stable food source in an unstable climate. Euro-American colonizers had the mindset that nature is seen as capital, with an emphasis on the possibility of unlimited profits. In order to farm on the Plains, they removed the grasses and tilled the soil, resulting in a sandy substrate that would quickly lose its ability to sustain crops, requiring a constant expansion of the farmland. In 1934, the wind lifted 350 million tons of earth and deposited it onto towns in blinding storms, causing the large-scale destruction of life and infrastructure.

        You believe the people and resources around you are expendable and that there is no reason not to take everything for yourself. You don’t stay in relationships very long but move from partner to partner, breaking all of their hearts. You believe that you have more value than others and think of them as inferiors. When your attitude wreaks havoc on your ability to make end’s meet, you will have to look within.
