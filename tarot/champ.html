        In the mid-19th century Vermont farmers turned to dairy farming, with the railroad allowing the export of milk to the cities. Following World War II, the industrialization of farming through the use of artificial fertilizer, as well as the abundance of cow manure, the process of eutrophication (pollution of phosphorus and other nutrients) began in Lake Champlain. In the erosion-prone, hilly land of the basin, rain flows across tilled land, picking up fertilizer and depositing it into the lake. The high levels of phosphorus cause cyanobacteria blooms: masses of toxic green bacteria cover the surface of the lake, suffocating the fish below due to its rapid consumption of oxygen.

        When you feel like you want to do something, you go all in — whether shopping sprees, binge drinking, or robbing a chain store, your addictive behaviors feel like they have no consequences. The longer you wait, the more entangled these behaviors will become in your lifestyle. You will have to gain a deeper understanding of how addictive behaviors make you feel and how to trust your intuition, or you will eventually be banned from the mall.
