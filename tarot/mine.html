        </br></br>
        In the late 1800s New Caledonia was discovered to have nickel deposits in its mountains. Between 1890 and 1990 miners moved a half billion tons of rock through opencast mining, involving decapitating the mountains. This caused streams to fill with debris, preventing fishing and navigation. Gravel was dumped on arable land and silt smothered nearby coral reefs. Residents lost their jobs, homes, and land as underpaid immigrants came in to work at the mines. Nearby, smelters caused air pollution, filling the sky with sulfuric fumes. Production only increased with the use of heavy machinery after 1950.

        When you want something, you often act as if on autopilot. Although you are skilled at following through to achieve your goals, there is a lack of thoughtfulness surrounding the way you go about your activities and what effect your actions have on your community. You act in ways that put you ahead at the expense of putting others ahead. Try to understand how it feels to be taken advantage of, so that you can act with empathy.
