        Engineers for the Japanese government occupying North China first envisioned a dam on the Yellow River in 1940. As the Chinese government continued developing the plans, the intended function slowly shifted from protecting farmers, to generating electricity. Officials needed to balance the maximum water level (which sets the amount of electricity produced) with the size of the reservoir (which must displace people from their homes). The completed dam had a high capacity for electric generation; but after only three years, the dam and large reservoir became silted, causing nearby lands to flood, destroying farmland and forcing engineers to let the sediment through the dam, reducing the electric capacity fourfold.

        You are holding back your emotions because you think you can do more, make more money, and live easier without them. Sometimes you lash out at others, but this is expected and does not bother you. Eventually, your emotions will become blocked and you will hurt those around you until you realize you must find a healthy way to express them.
