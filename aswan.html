        </br></br>
       In the 19th century the Egyptian government sought to begin cultivating summer cash crops such as cotton and maize in place of the winter crops that were traditionally grown in the area. Irrigation barrages were built, but the new systems were susceptible to flooding, causing instability in the country’s food supply. More construction schemes were drawn up in the 20th century: in order to build a high dam, President Nasser seized the Suez Canal and insisted the US and Britain finance the Aswan Dam. The dam’s reservoir entailed the displacement of fifty thousand neighboring Nubians, the army called to remove them from their homes. The dam provided the necessary flood control for the summer crops to flourish, but with reduced silt from the Nile, chemical fertilizers were used heavily; and without the annual flood, salt would build up. The Nile delta shrunk and the coastline receded, destroying many fisheries. These changes at first allowed the population to double, but over time the natural resources could not properly support the population.

        You use your strong emotions in order to manipulate others into doing what you want. Those around you are fearful of how you might react if they do not go along. You feel the need to go against the grain and are quick to oppose others, threatening to have a breakdown if questioned. Even though you envision great things and make plans to achieve your goals, you are often blind to the ways in which your plans cause harm to others.
